# Data-Mining-Project
Data Mining project analyzing the impact of social media on academic performance of undergraduates

## Project Goal
This project aims to analyze and classify the impact of social media usage on the academic performance of undergraduate students. Using data mining techniques such as classification (Decision Tree) and clustering (K-means), we will investigate how different patterns of social media behavior influence students' academic outcomes.

## Motivation
Social media has become an essential part of students' daily lives, and its influence on academic performance is a widely discussed topic. By applying data mining methods, this project seeks to uncover meaningful patterns and provide insights into how social media usage affects study habits, concentration, and overall academic success.
