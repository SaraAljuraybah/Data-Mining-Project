# Data-Mining-Project
Data Mining project analyzing the impact of social media on academic performance of undergraduates

## Project Goal
This project aims to analyze and classify the impact of social media usage on the academic performance of undergraduate students. Using data mining techniques such as classification (Decision Tree) and clustering (K-means), we will investigate how different patterns of social media behavior influence students' academic outcomes.

## Motivation
Social media has become an essential part of students' daily lives, and its influence on academic performance is a widely discussed topic. By applying data mining methods, this project seeks to uncover meaningful patterns and provide insights into how social media usage affects study habits, concentration, and overall academic success.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Impact of Social Media on Academic Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aderonkeayobami/impact-of-social-media-on-academic-performances)  
- Format: Excel (3028 rows, 47 columns)  
- Class Label: `Impact on Academic Performance` (Likert scale: 1–5)

## Deliverables

- **Phase 1 (Data Selection)**  
  - Raw dataset uploaded to `Dataset/Raw_dataset.xlsx`.  
  - Initial analysis in `Reports/Phase1.ipynb` (dataset description, class label distribution).  
  - Related research paper in `References/`.  

- **Phase 2 (Data Summarization & Preprocessing)**  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
  - Data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing steps.  
  - Preprocessed dataset saved as `Dataset/Preprocessed_dataset.csv`.  
  - Work documented in `Reports/Phase2.ipynb`.  

- **Phase 3 (Data Mining & Evaluation)**  
  - Apply classification (Decision Tree with Gini & Entropy).  
  - Apply clustering (K-means, Silhouette score, Elbow method).  
  - Compare results and discuss findings.  
  - Final report in `Reports/Phase3.ipynb`.
