# Data-Mining-Project

Data Mining project analyzing the impact of social media on academic performance of undergraduates. Most features are binary(0/1) indicating usage pattrens, while the target column is a Likert scale (0-5).

## Project Goal
This project aims to analyze and classify the impact of social media usage on the academic performance of undergraduate students. Using data mining techniques such as classification and clustering, we will investigate how different patterns of social media behavior influence students' academic outcomes.

## Motivation
Social media is a major part of students’ daily life, but it often affects focus, study habits, and academic success. Since most students face this challenge, our project aims to explore the impact of social media on academic performance using data mining to discover real patterns and insights.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Impact of Social Media on Academic Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aderonkeayobami/impact-of-social-media-on-academic-performances)  
- Format: Excel (3028 rows, 47 columns)  
- Class Label: `Impact on Academic Performance` (Likert scale: 1–5)

## Deliverables

- **Phase 1 (Data Selection)**  
  - Raw dataset uploaded to `Dataset/Raw_dataset.xlsx`.  
  - Initial analysis in `Reports/Phase1.ipynb` (dataset description, class label distribution).  
  - Related research paper in `Dataset/`.  

- **Phase 2 (Data Summarization & Preprocessing)**  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
  - Data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing steps.  
  - Preprocessed dataset saved as `Dataset/Preprocessed_dataset.csv`.  
  - Work documented in `Reports/Phase2.ipynb`.  

- **Phase 3 (Data Mining & Evaluation)**  
  - Apply classification (Decision Tree with Gini & Entropy).  
  - Apply clustering (K-means, Silhouette score, Elbow method).  
  - Compare results and discuss findings.  
  - Final report in `Reports/Phase3.ipynb`.
